My name is David Ranzolin, and I am an institutional research analyst at San Francisco State University. I have several 'sportsing' hobbies (basketball, golf, archery)
several 'nerdy' hobbies (coding, Soren Kierkegaard, dead languages, and Raspberry Pi), and one perfect hobby (hanging out with my cats.)

I studied English literature and religious studies, finishing my M.T.S from Emory University in 2013. Sometime in the recent past I was exposed to computer programming, and I quickly learned that writing code was more fun than writing papers.

For data analysis and visualization, I use SQL, R, and D3.js. Other tools and applications: ESRI ArcMap, IBM Cognos Analytic, Git/GitHub

I love to hoop, golf, lift, shoot arrows, code, try to understand Kierkegaard and dead languages, and chill with my cats.

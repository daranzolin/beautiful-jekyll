<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
I studied English literature and religious studies, finishing my M.T.S from Emory University in 2013. After school I quickly learned that writing code was more fun than writing papers.

For data analysis and visualization, I use SQL, R, D3.js, and a little HTML/CSS. Other tools and applications: 
<ul>
  <li>ESRI ArcMap</li>
  <li>Git/GitHub</li>
  <li>Observable</li>
  <li>IBM Cognos Analytics</li>
</ul>

I love to hoop, golf, lift, shoot arrows, code, try to understand Kierkegaard and dead languages, and chill with my cats.

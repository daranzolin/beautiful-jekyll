My name is David Ranzolin, and I am a data analyst at UCSC Extension Silicon Valley. I have several active hobbies (basketball, golf, archery)
several nerdy hobbies (coding, obscure works of philosophy, dead languages, and Raspberry Pi), and only one perfect hobby (hanging out with my cats.)  

I studied English literature and religious studies, finishing my M.T.S from Emory University in 2013. Sometime in the recent past I was exposed to computer programming, and I quickly learned that writing code was more enjoyable than writing papers. Now I'm busy honing my analysis skills (R, databases, statistics), furthering my web development skills (HTML, CSS, JS), and jumping into the world of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology.

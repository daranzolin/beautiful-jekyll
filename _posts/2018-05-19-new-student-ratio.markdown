I have yet to learn the [tidy evaluation paradigm.](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/tidy-eval/) Typically, violating
DRY principles with a combination of hacks and brute force gets the job done. But a recent challenge at work took me perilously
to the edge.

The task was this: calculate the ratio of returning and new students by academic quarter. Our working definition of a returning student is having taken any course in a previous quarter. 

Let's build some sample data:

<!--more-->

{% highlight r %}

library(tidyverse)

set.seed(2018)

ids <- 1:5000
start_dates <- seq(as.Date("2010/01/01"), as.Date("2018/05/18"), by = "day")
departments <- c("Math", "Science", "English", "History", "Modern Languages")

generate_data <- function(reps, samp, size) {
  c(replicate(size, sample(samp, size = size, replace = TRUE)))
}

ids <- generate_data(100, ids, 100)
departments <- generate_data(100, departments, 100)
start_dates <- start_dates %>% 
  sample(500, TRUE) %>% 
  sample(10000, TRUE)

df <- tibble(
  student_id = ids,
  department = departments,
  class_start_date = start_dates
) %>% 
  mutate(quarter = lubridate::quarter(class_start_date),
         year = lubridate::year(class_start_date)) %>% 
  mutate(
    quarter = case_when(
      quarter == 1 ~ "Winter",
      quarter == 2 ~ "Spring",
      quarter == 3 ~ "Summer",
      quarter == 4 ~ "Fall"
      ),
    school = case_when(
      department %in% c("Math", "Science") ~ "STEM",
      TRUE ~ "Liberal Arts"
      )
    ) %>% 
  mutate(quarter = paste(quarter, year)) %>%
  select(student_id, school, department, class_start_date, quarter, year) 

{% endhighlight %}

A glace at our generated data:

# ... with 9,990 more rows
```
To calculate the ratios, I had to encode the quarter variable as a factor. And to get the chronological levels,
I arranged the data frame by class start date, pulled out the unique quarters, and factored the original quarter variable
with the appropriate levels.

{% highlight r %}

quarters <- df %>% 
  arrange(class_start_date) %>% 
  pull(quarter) %>% 
  unique() 
quarters <- factor(quarters, levels = quarters)

df <- df %>% mutate(quarter = factor(quarter, levels = quarters))

{% endhighlight %}

A useful attribute of factors is that they can be converted to integers. For example, note how each factor level corresponds
to an ascending integer:

```
> quarters
 [1] Winter 2010 Spring 2010 Summer 2010 Fall 2010   Winter 2011 Spring 2011 Summer 2011 Fall 2011  
 [9] Winter 2012 Spring 2012 Summer 2012 Fall 2012   Winter 2013 Spring 2013 Summer 2013 Fall 2013  
[17] Winter 2014 Spring 2014 Summer 2014 Fall 2014   Winter 2015 Spring 2015 Summer 2015 Fall 2015  
[25] Winter 2016 Spring 2016 Summer 2016 Fall 2016   Winter 2017 Spring 2017 Summer 2017 Fall 2017  
[33] Winter 2018 Spring 2018
34 Levels: Winter 2010 Spring 2010 Summer 2010 Fall 2010 Winter 2011 Spring 2011 ... Spring 2018

> as.integer(quarters)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33
[34] 34
```
I then tried to imagine the data frame as a timeline with the temporal markers as quarters. For example, I could identify
all the new students for a given quarter by (1) subsetting the data with all quarters "less than" (earlier than) that specific quarter, (2) identifying the unique quarters by student, and (3) filtering for the quarter, and then checking if the unique quarters match the given quarter.

The entirety of my function is below, but I'll break the pipeline down here.

### Step 1: Filtering all Earlier Quarters

The `quarter_td` argument is first factored with the same levels as the data frame, then converted to an integer. I'm then able to filter the earlier quarters within the data frame.

{% highlight r %}

calc_new_students <- function(quarter_td, ...) {
  
  quarter_td_int <- as.integer(factor(quarter_td, levels = quarters))
  
  df %>% 
    filter(as.integer(quarter) <= quarter_td_int)
    ...
}
  calc_new_students("Fall 2015", department) %>% 
    distinct(quarter) %>%
    arrange(desc(quarter)) 
    
{% endhighlight %}

```
# A tibble: 24 x 1
   quarter    
   <fct>      
 1 Fall 2015  
 2 Summer 2015
 3 Spring 2015
 4 Winter 2015
 5 Fall 2014  
 6 Summer 2014
 7 Spring 2014
 8 Winter 2014
 9 Fall 2013  
10 Summer 2013
# ... with 14 more rows

```

### Step 2: Indentify Unique Quarters by Student

Collapsing the unique quarters into a vector produces a snapshot of their registration history.

{% highlight r %}

calc_new_students <- function(quarter_td, ...) {
    
    ...
    group_by(student_id) %>%
    mutate(unique_quarters = paste(unique(quarter), collapse = ", ")) %>%
    ungroup() 
    ...
}

calc_new_students("Fall 2015") %>% 
  select(student_id, unique_quarters)

{% endhighlight %}

```
# A tibble: 7,083 x 2
   student_id unique_quarters                                            
        <int> <chr>                                                      
 1       1681 Winter 2010, Winter 2012                                   
 2       2319 Winter 2013, Summer 2013, Winter 2012, Fall 2010           
 3        303 Summer 2014, Summer 2010                                   
 4        988 Summer 2011, Spring 2012, Fall 2011, Spring 2013           
 5       2372 Fall 2013, Winter 2012, Winter 2015                        
 6       1506 Winter 2012, Winter 2010, Fall 2012                        
 7        651 Fall 2013, Winter 2010, Summer 2012, Fall 2012, Summer 2015
 8       4794 Winter 2015                                                
 9       2735 Winter 2012, Spring 2014, Winter 2011, Fall 2013           
10       4911 Spring 2012, Fall 2013                                     
# ... with 7,073 more rows
```

### Step 3: Indentify New and Returning Students

If a student's `unique_quarters` is length one and matches the quarter argument, they are a new student. If not, they are a returning student.

{% highlight r %}

calc_new_students <- function(quarter_td, ...) {
  
    ...
    filter(as.integer(quarter) == quarter_td_int) %>% 
    distinct(student_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
    mutate(student = if_else(unique_quarters == quarter_td, "New", "Returning"))
    ...
}

calc_new_students("Fall 2015") %>% 
  select(student_id, student)

{% endhighlight %}

```
# A tibble: 350 x 2
   student_id student  
        <int> <chr>    
 1       1301 New      
 2       3022 New      
 3       2049 Returning
 4       3229 Returning
 5       1610 Returning
 6       2671 Returning
 7       3857 New      
 8        431 New      
 9       2383 Returning
10       1311 Returning
# ... with 340 more rows
```

### Step 4: Group the New and Returning Students by Other Columns

I'm able to generalize the function to group by other column names by passing them through `...`. 

{% highlight r %}

calc_new_students <- function(quarter_td, ...) {
    
    ...
    group_by(student, ...) %>% 
    summarize(students = n()) %>% 
    arrange(...) %>% 
    mutate(quarter = quarter_td)
}

calc_new_students("Fall 2015", department) 
calc_new_students("Fall 2015", school) 

{% endhighlight %}

```
# A tibble: 10 x 4
# Groups:   student [2]
   student   department       students quarter  
   <chr>     <chr>               <int> <chr>    
 1 New       English                15 Fall 2015
 2 Returning English                62 Fall 2015
 3 New       History                15 Fall 2015
 4 Returning History                54 Fall 2015
 5 New       Math                   14 Fall 2015
 6 Returning Math                   65 Fall 2015
 7 New       Modern Languages       17 Fall 2015
 8 Returning Modern Languages       45 Fall 2015
 9 New       Science                23 Fall 2015
10 Returning Science                40 Fall 2015
```

```
# A tibble: 4 x 4
# Groups:   student [2]
  student   school       students quarter  
  <chr>     <chr>           <int> <chr>    
1 New       Liberal Arts       47 Fall 2015
2 Returning Liberal Arts      161 Fall 2015
3 New       STEM               37 Fall 2015
4 Returning STEM              105 Fall 2015
```

### Step 5: Iterate through all Quarters

Now we can loop through all the quarters and bind the new and returning students into a data frame:

{% highlight r %}

all_quarters <- quarters %>% 
  map_dfr(calc_new_students)

{% endhighlight %}

And a final visualization!

{% highlight r %}

ggplot(all_quarters, aes(quarter, students, fill = student)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(x = "Quarter",
       y = "",
       title = "Ratio of New and Returning Students",
       subtitle = "2010-2018") +
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
  
{% endhighlight %}

 Obviously in this closed, generated data, the proportion of returning students grows with each successive quarter. But with
 some additional tinkering, some interesting, seasonal, patterns may emerge.
